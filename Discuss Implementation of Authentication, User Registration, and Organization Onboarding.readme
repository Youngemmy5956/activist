1. Discuss and Plan the Implementation of Authentication:

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users accessing a system. In the context of the "activist-org" project, discussing and planning authentication involves:

Method Selection: Determining which authentication methods or mechanisms will be used. This can include traditional email/password, social media logins (e.g., using Google or Facebook accounts), or single sign-on (SSO) systems.

Security Measures: Implementing security measures to safeguard user credentials, such as password hashing and encryption to protect sensitive data.

User Roles and Permissions: Defining user roles and permissions, which specify what actions different types of users can perform within the system. For example, administrators may have more permissions than regular users.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Considering the implementation of 2FA to enhance security. This typically involves a secondary verification method, like a one-time code sent to the user's mobile device.

Session Management: Developing a system to manage user sessions, ensuring that users are automatically logged out after a period of inactivity.

Error Handling: Planning for how the system will handle failed login attempts and provide user-friendly error messages.

2. Discuss and Plan the Implementation of User Registration:

User registration is the process through which new users create accounts on the platform. Discussing and planning user registration entails:

User Profile Information: Deciding what user information is required during the registration process. Common fields include name, email, and password.

Email Verification: Implementing a verification step where users receive a verification link via email to confirm the legitimacy of their accounts.

Captcha and Anti-Bot Measures: Including methods to prevent automated or bot-driven registration, often through CAPTCHA challenges or other anti-bot measures.

User Experience: Ensuring that the user registration process is user-friendly with clear instructions and feedback.

Privacy and Data Protection: Ensuring that user data is protected and that the registration process complies with data privacy regulations, such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

3. Discuss and Plan the Implementation of Organization Onboarding:

Organization onboarding focuses on how organizations join and interact with the platform. Planning organization onboarding involves:

Organization Registration: Allowing organizations to create accounts with additional details, such as a name, description, and contact information.

Verification and Approval: Implementing a process to verify and approve organizations to ensure they meet the platform's criteria or policies.

User Roles within Organizations: Defining roles within organizations, such as administrators and members, and specifying permissions for each role.

Organization Profile: Creating the capability for organizations to set up profiles with features like adding logos, descriptions, and relevant information.

Data Sharing Permissions: Defining how data is shared between organizations and their members, ensuring that organizations have control over their data.

Collaboration Features: Including features that enable organizations to collaborate with other organizations or individual users.

Organization Dashboard: Developing a dashboard for organizations to manage settings and activities related to their presence on the platform.
